0.2

  * Support for automatic discovery of wiimotes (Krishna Gadepalli,
    L. Donnie Smith).

  * Renamed the library to libcwiimote because of name conflict with another
    library (CWiid).

  * Changed tilt entry in wiimote to use floats instead of unsigned shorts
    (can be disabled by compiling without _ENABLE_TILT).

  * Added a new entry, force, in wiimote which holds the force on each axis
    in g (can be disabled by compiling without _ENABLE_FORCE).
